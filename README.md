# TURN-BASED CARDGAME

This turn-based cardgame is inspired by popular online cardgames like Magic and Hearthstone, and features new mechanics and unique interactions. 

Ensure you have the necessary libraries downloaded in requirements.txt. There is also a short (outdated) mini demo on the gameplay. There might be plans in the future to include new regions such as "Ice", "Shadow" and "Light". Enjoy the current version. Right now there are a few decks created for you, but you can create your own decks under "deck collection". Enjoy!

This project was done in collaboration with Sim Yew Chong from National University of Singapore.
